          My name is Moxiao He. I usually go by Mox. I'm studying computer science at Northeastern University.
          Currently I'm living in Seattle. My interest is in web development and full-stack project. I have done two
          intership at Intuit and Facebook respectively. I finished undergraudate degree in Eletrical and Eletronic Engineering, during
          which the first two years was in Beijing and the last two years was in Manchester, UK. I love this experience. Studying in
          three different countires allow to know people around the world and different cultures. Besides my work and study, I'm a big fan of basketball.
          I love playing games with my friends and watching NBA. My favorite teams are Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors. I also like pop music and EDM.
          Drake and Chris Brown are my favorite singers.
